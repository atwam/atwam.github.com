    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we have our vagrant box working with chef, let's use chef to configure our services and our app.

## Chef roles

Assuming that you have read some basics about chef, you'll know that the cookbooks we have downloaded provide recipes for installing various software.
We could ask vagrant to install a few recipes, but it's probably better to assemble them in roles.
We'll then assign the roles to one or several nodes, or use all of them on our box for testing.

For now, we probably want to have one `base` role (to install common software on all our nodes) and two roles to serve our application :

* `database\_master` : a simple install of postgres should be fine here.
* `app\_server` : this one will serve our RoR app.

One could think of other roles (workers, redis etc), but for my purpose and for now these two (and the `base` role) should be fine.

## Base role

We want our base role to include the following :

* *apt*, *git*, *sudo* and *build-essential* should be installed. We'll use the default cookbooks/recipes for each of these.
* *users setup* : Should create the users (with their ssh key), give them sudo rights. We'll use the `users` cookbook.

We start by editing our `Berksfile` to make sure all the cookbooks are included (`sudo`, `apt`, `git`, `build-essential`, `users`).
Then let's create a role file.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>roles/base.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;base&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">description</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Base role applied to all nodes.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">run_list</span><span class="p">(</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;recipe[apt]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;recipe[build-essential]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;recipe[git]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;recipe[users::sysadmins]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;recipe[sudo]&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

*The order matters here !* _apt_ should appear first (it's used to handle packages), _build-essential_ is used by pretty much
everything, and especially by `ruby-shadow` which is a gem dependency of `users`.

Reading [the documentation of the users cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/users), we see that we should define the users in a data bag
(a way of telling chef about some data, list, including potentially encrypted password and ssh keys).

Chef solo doesn't work very well with data bags (or the CLI doesn't work very well), so we'll just create the file manually.
Also, we see in the users cookbook that it requires `chef-solo-search` to run with chef-solo.

Adding `cookbook 'chef-solo-search', git: "https://github.com/edelight/chef-solo-search.git"` to our `Berksfile` should be good enough.

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Now we need to modify our `Vagrantfile` to use this role (and not the dummy git recipe we were using). An extra bit of precaution is needed here :
the `sudo` cookbook/recipe will install `sudo` qnd configure it by default for the sysadmin group (lucky us, our user is a member).
*It will override vagrant's sudo config, breaking vagrant provision using chef-solo*. To avoid that, we use vagrant's `chef.json` config
to override the `sudo` configuration attributes for vagrant :

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">chef</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_role</span> <span class="s2">&quot;base&quot;</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="ss">:authorization</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="ss">:sudo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="ss">:users</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;vagrant&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="ss">:passwordless</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Then it's on to `vagrant provision`, and ssh to whatever port was forwarded to 22 (for me it was `ssh localhost -p 2222`) to see that you log in
using your ssh key.

If you hit a json parsing exception when chef reads your user json file, make sure you don't have trailing commas.
You can check your JSON easily in `irb` using `require 'json'; JSON.parse(File.read('data_bags/users/wam.json'))`.

### Creating a custom cookbook ...
 
There's a big choice to do here. We could either create a whole separate cookbook just for our app, configured with many
default recipes, or for now just use an already created one.

It is very likely that I'll have to create a cookbook at some point, because it's the only way to have your own recipes
and reach a high enough level of customization.

### .. or use and existing one
I originally had a look at the [database cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/database) but finally decided
to go the fast way by using two very neat cookbooks, [rackbox](https://github.com/teohm/rackbox-cookbook) and [databox](https://github.com/teohm/databox-cookbook).
It will probably make sense to use `database` and `application` cookbooks, but they seem to be easier to work with when you are using a proper chef server
and your own cookbook/recipes.

`rackbox` includes `appbox` by default, which creates its own users for deployment/app running.
I have found that these cookbooks are a bit limited for my taste (for example, they don't use data\_bags, which are a proper way of encrypting
password instead of storing them in your chef repository... Well, next time.

## Setting up our roles

Let's start by adding the cookbooks to our `Berksfile` and run `berks install`
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Berksfile</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s2">&quot;runit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&gt;= 1.1.2&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># HACK: force-use this version</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s2">&quot;databox&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rackbox&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

and create our `roles/database_master.rb`. We are using non encrypted passwords here, which isn't very secure.
We should actually use encrypted data bags, but they don't play very nicely with roles (they are supposed to be used with recipes, which
would mean custom cookbook), nor do they play nicely with `knife solo` (although a plugin exist, but it didn't work very well
in my tests). Let's start this way, we'll see later to move to a more robust non solo chef.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>roles/database_master.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;database_master&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">description</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Master postgresql node&quot;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">run_list</span><span class="p">(</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="ss">:postgresql</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;database_name&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;myapp_production&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;username&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;myapp&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;password&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ANOTHER_PASSWORD_HERE&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">}</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Now running `vagrant provision` (or `vagrant up` or `vagrant reload` depending on whether your current vagrant box is up or not) should run this recipe, adding
the `myapp` database. We can test that in `vagrant ssh`
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>psql -h localhost -d myapp_production -U myapp -W
</span><span class='line'>Password <span class="k">for </span>user myapp:
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#psql (9.1.9)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#[...] Yeepee</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

## What's next

Next post will be about configuring a proper rails box using `rackbox`, setting up capistrano to deploy ... then deploy to a vps and get closer to production.
I'm still not entirely happy with this deployment today. I should move to a proper cookbook, as I said, to get more customization options.
For now, I want my app out, and will probably work a bit more later depending on how successful it is. The beauty of chef, after all, is that it makes
it easy to set up new nodes and new deployments.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[So, let's be honest, I've been quite lazy here. My latest rails application was deployed with Heroku. Lots of fun, a very pleasant experience.
But now I have this new shinny application that I don't want to deploy using Heroku :

* Because I am worried that if I start with Heroku, I'll be too lazy to switch later.
* Because I know that at some point, my application is going to need plugins and binaries that I can't get on Heroku.
* Because I'd rather have a portable application that I can deploy easily on any type of server.

<!--more-->

## 1. Planning and strategy
I have this nice application, let's call it cube. So far it has lived very happily in rails dev environment, run only by the marvelous [pow](http://pow.cx).

My goal is to have :

* A server configuration using chef
* An easy deployment using capistrano
* A way to locally run a copy of the server deployment using vagrant

This should allow me to easily change/add services on my box, and scale it up should the need arise.
So, the plan is the following :

1. Install `vagrant`, that I'll use to launch virtualized servers to test my chef configuration.
2. Prepare a chef configuration for two roles : app server and database server. 
I'll start by having the same machine (in vagrant for now) running the two roles, knowing that I'll be able to split that to more servers if I need to scale.
3. Setup capistrano on my rails app to have it deploy nicely to my machines.

## 2. Vagrant for testing locally the server configuration

Well, it'll be short. Head over to [vagrant's website](http://www.vagrantup.com) where its marvelous developper has done a very complete getting-started guide.
Once installed (and don't forget to install virtualbox too), I'm pretty much following it.
I'll chose the `precise64` box, an ubuntu 64 bits image, but you can of course choose another box found [here](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)

I'll start by creating a directory that will hold our deployment related configuration : vagrant and chef's config.
I have chosen to have this directory separate from my application's directory.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir deployment <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>deployment
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant init
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box <span class="c"># Downloads the box</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Then let's edit our `Vagrantfile` to change a few defaults to better suit us :

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Vagrantfile</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Vagrant</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># This line ensures that we&#39;ll know where to find the box should we clone our deployment repo on another computer</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">box_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

We just start the box with `vagrant up` and check that we manage to connect to it using `vagrant ssh`. It's working, great, we have a blank slate to work on !

## 3. Chef in the kitchen

[Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) will be used to handle the configuration/bootstrapping of my servers.
I've done my fair share of playing with ssh in the past, only to realize that administering a server for a side project using ssh is fun until
you have to come back to it after a few months and remember where all the things are and where you should do you change.

With chef, the configuration is stored on git, and if I need to change anything, there's only one place to go.
Soooo, let's start.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="c"># I&#39;m still in my deployment directory that I created earlier</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat &gt; Gemfile <span class="s">&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">source :rubygems</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">gem &quot;chef&quot; # The main gem</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">gem &quot;knife-solo&quot; # Chef solo to bootstrap/configure chef on individual machines through ssh</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">gem &quot;berkshelf&quot; # To manage cookbooks</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">EOF</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

If you see an error requesting gecode when you run `bundle install` then `brew install --use-llvm gecode` should be good enough to make it work.
It may be a bit more complicated than that, just look at [this blog post](/blog/2013/04/25/building-dep-selector-on-mac-os-x/) if you have issues installing the gems above.

That should cover the installation of the main `chef` gem and of `knife-solo`. Chef can be configured to use with a chef server (useful to manage many machines)
but for now I'll be using `knife-solo` (also known as chef-solo) which should be good enough.

Now let's initiate a chef repository in my directory. This repository will hold all the configuration for the server(s) I am going to deploy to.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>knife solo init . <span class="c"># Creates the chef-repo here</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

If you have read a bit about chef (of course you have), you know that one of the main ingredients (ahah) are the *cookbooks*.
Opscode has gathered many cookbooks contributed by the community.
The standard way of installing these cookbook is through `knife cookbook site install blah`, but I have included the [berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) gem which will handle
our `cookbooks` directory for us and get all the proper cookbooks and their dependencies. The list of cookbooks is managed in a `Berksfile`.

For now, let's start by installing some cookbooks. We'll see later to configure them and our app.

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Berksfile</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">site</span> <span class="ss">:opscode</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s1">&#39;apt&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s1">&#39;build-essential&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nginx&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s1">&#39;database&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cookbook</span> <span class="s1">&#39;git&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
A few comments on these cookbooks ..

apt
: Used to make sure this package manager is installed on the ubuntu box that we'll be using.

build-essential
: Make sure we can build stuff. This one will be included anyway since it's a dependency of for many other packages.

[nginx](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nginx)
: Planning to use this lightweight web server to serve our rails app

[database](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/database)
: This cookbook is an alternative to the [`postgresql`](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/postgresql). It can install mysql or postgresql and should allow us later to use a master/slave configuration.

Now let's make sure these cookbooks are there and available :
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>berks install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

## 4. Make vagrant use chef

Now we'll need to make vagrant use our chef cookbooks and recives, so that we'll be able to test our chef configuration.
For now we'll just make sure it installs correctly a simple recipe (git, for example). We'll cover the proper configuration
of our servers in a later post.

Since we are using berkshelf to manage our cookbooks, we'd better use the `vagrant-berkshelf` plugin :
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Now let's add a few lines in our `Vagrantfile` :

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Vagrantfile</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Vagrant</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># [snip] our previous config</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">berkshelf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># The following is not necessary because we use berkshelf</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># For now let&#39;s just install git to check that our chef provisioning is working</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">chef</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;git&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># We&#39;ll use the following later</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># chef.add_role &quot;web&quot; </span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

Now we need to `vagrant reload` to make vagrant recreate a machine and install the required chef folders,
then `vagrant provision` to make chef-solo install whatever is needed. A `vagrant ssh` followed by a `git --version`
should help you verify that our chef provisionning worked.

You can see in our `Vagrantfile` above that we just asked chef-solo to run the `git` recipe.
Looking at [git cookbook's documentation](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git),
we can see that this will run the `git::default` recipe of this cookbook, which should just install git.

Let's remember that in the future running `vagrant provision` will rerun chef on our vm, so we'll
be able to quickly test our changes in config.

## 5. Server and app configuration with chef
I'll cover that in my next post.
